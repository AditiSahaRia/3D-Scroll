Website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. The 3D scrolling code is from other source.
https://github.com/peachananr/tiltedpage_scroll

I have used "tiltedpage-scroll.css" and "jquery.tiltedpage-scroll.js" this two files from the demo folder of “tiltedpage_scroll” repository.

I have also used bootstrap framework for this project.
